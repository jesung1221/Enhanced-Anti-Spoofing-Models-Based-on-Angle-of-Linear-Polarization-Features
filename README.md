# Anti-Spoofing with Polarization Camera

This repository contains the implementation for the thesis project **"Anti-Spoofing with Polarization Camera"**, which explores the use of Angle of Linear Polarization (AoLP) features for robust face anti-spoofing. The project leverages sparse polarization pixels combined with a MobileNetV3 model to achieve high accuracy in detecting spoofing attacks.

## Overview
Face recognition systems are increasingly susceptible to spoofing attacks using materials such as printed photos, screen displays, and 3D masks. This project introduces a novel anti-spoofing approach using AoLP colormaps generated by a polarization camera. Key highlights include:
- Training models with varying levels of sparse polarization pixels.
- Validation of the robustness of the method under low-light conditions and diverse spoofing scenarios.

## Features
- **Pretrained MobileNetV3 Model**: Utilizes weights from ImageNet for efficient feature extraction.
- **Custom Dataset Support**: Processes polarization images with AoLP colormaps.
- **Metrics**: Includes ROC-AUC, Equal Error Rate (EER), and HTER calculations.
- **Sparsity Analysis**: Tests the model's performance with varying levels of sparse polarization pixels.
